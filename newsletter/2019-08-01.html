  <p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>

  <p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>

  <p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>

  <p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>. If you find any errors in this month’s issue please <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="updates-from-the-solid-community">Updates from the Solid Community</h2>

  <p>In the W3C Solid Community Call there was a conversation about making sure all repositories in the Solid GitHub are active with clear descriptions of what they are for and who is working for and to archive inactive repositories. If you are working on Solid GitHub repositories please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/repo-overview.md">repo overview</a> to make sure your work is correctly represented and that all the information is up to date.</p>
