<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>

<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>

<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>

<p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>. If you find any errors in this month’s issue please <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-solid-call">Weekly Solid Call</h2>

<p>Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/1">scope of the standardisation work</a> being carried out by panellists and editors between now and the 19th December here. <a href="https://github.com/solid/process">Contributions are welcome.</a></p>

<p>There are no updates from the editors on the standardisation work this week.</p>

<h2 id="solid-implementations">Solid Implementations</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/releases/tag/v5.2.0">Node Solid Server 5.2.0</a> was released. This includes a new version of the Solid Data Browser and a much needed fix to the handling of content-types.</p>

<p>If you have any new apps, Pods, or identity providers, or there are updates to existing Solid implementations, make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next week’s edition.</p>

<p>Until next week!</p>
