  <h2>Solid Implementation</h2>
  <p>This week there are no updates or new <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-apps">apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/solid/pods">Pods</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list">identity providers</a>.</p>
  <h2>Solid Development</h2>
  <p>The Solid standard is currently referred to as <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification">the specification</a> and is being led by the <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones">editors</a>. The focus at the moment is to define the scope of a Solid spec deliverable for December by <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification/issues">submitting issues to the specification repository</a>. On the 27th December the editors will finalise the decision on which issues to include in the December deliverable scope by organising them into a defined <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones">milestone</a>.</p>
  <h2>Updates on Solid Projects</h2>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects">Solid projects</a> are activities happening on the Solid GitHub other than panels. Below are the links to where there were active conversations on each of the projects.</p>

  <p>Are you interested in leading the Node Solid Server Project? The current team are looking for support so if you are interested reach out solid+info@theodi.org.</p>
  <p>There has been some speculation about changes and just to reassure you that there are no concrete changes on the horizon and if there are I’ll be sure to keep you posted.</p>
