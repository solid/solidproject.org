<h3>Solid Implementations</h3>

<li>The Dutch cultural heritage institutions and the ministry of Education, Culture and Science are working together in a joined national digital heritage program (NDE) to enlarge the social relevance of the digital cultural heritage information created and maintained by these institutes. The activities of NDE are focused on improving the visibility, usability and sustainability of the available digital cultural heritage information. In general the larger organizations in the network are equipped with fairly modern collection management systems. The NDE works with the IT-suppliers of these systems to support newer functionality such as Linked Data technologies. But there is still a large group of smaller institutes and associations that lack functionality to share their information in a digital and modern way. The “Solid for small cultural heritage institutions project” is aimed at this group of organisations and will provide easy to use tools to maintain and publish their data on the web. By using Solid these organizations will stay in control of their own data and at the same time be fully compliant with the state-of-the-art web publishing standards that will improve the visibility, usability and sustainability of their information. The project is set out to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and will run for one year.</li>
