<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>
<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>
<p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>. If you find any errors in this month’s issue please <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>

<h2>Panel Conversation to Generate Proposals</h2>
<p>Solid Panels are groups of individuals focused on a specific problem or domain relevant to Solid, with an aim to propose changes to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, and/or Supporting Documentation.

<p>Here is an overview of active panel conversations this week.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/solid/specification">Solid Specification</a></h3>

In response an issue has been opened where you can <a href="https://github.com/solid/process/issues/100">submit proposals on how to resolve it</a> and <a href="https://github.com/solid/process/issues/100">vote</a> by putting a thumbs up or thumbs down on proposals you support or don’t support.</td>
