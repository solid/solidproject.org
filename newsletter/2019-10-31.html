  <h1>This Week in Solid 2019-10-31</h1>
  <p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>
  <p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
  <p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>
  <p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>.
