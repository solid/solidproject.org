<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>
<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>
<p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>.

<h2>Solid Apps, Pods, and ID</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/SharonStrats/SolidRestaurantSearch">LBSPrototype</a></strong> is a way to search for restaurants by location. Update Location adds three location files each with a different precision based on your current location, RestaurantSearch uses your location added to find your nearest restaurants, FindMyFriend shows you friends location detail if they have it and to the level they have specified on their POD to the location files. LBSPrototype was created as part of a masters research project at the University of Melbourne, Australia</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://notepod.vincenttunru.com/">Notepod</a></strong> is a new simple note-taking app that stores notes in your Solid Pod. It was created as a demonstration of how to create Solid apps — inspect <a href="https://gitlab.com/vincenttunru/notepod/commits/master">its commit messages</a> for more detailed guidance on <a href="https://gitlab.com/vincenttunru/notepod/commit/5c534abdd2d6ed18be8ddc256427fb7bc0baae71">reading data</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/vincenttunru/notepod/commit/f42f8ae6e55f1a1996050d5061252b5ac615b5aa">authenticating</a>, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any new <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-apps">apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/solid/pods">Pods</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list">identity providers</a>, or there are updates to existing Solid implementations, make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next week’s edition.</p>
<h2>The Solid Standard</h2>
<p>The data interoperability panel and the authorisation panel are starting to collaborate around the intersection of how data is organised and discovered in the pod and how users authorise access to it.</p>
<p>Until next week!</p>
