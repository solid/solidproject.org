    <p about="#i" datatype="rdf:HTML" property="doap:shortdesc">Solid is an open standard for structuring data, digital identities, and applications on the <span about="#i" property="doap:platform">Web</span>.</p>
    <p>Solid aims to support the creation of the Web as Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally envisioned it when he
        invented the Web at CERN in 1989. Tim sometimes refers to Solid as "the web - take 3" — or Web3.0 —
        because Solid integrates a new layer of standards into the Web we already have. The goal of Solid is
        for people to have more <span about="#i" property="doap:category">agency</span> over their data.</p>

        <p>Solid is a <span about="#i" rel="doap:implements" resource="https://solidproject.org/TR/">specification</span> that lets people store their data securely in <span about="#i" property="doap:category">decentralized data stores</span>
            called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for your data.</p>
        <p>Entities control access to the data in their Pod. Entities decide what data to share and with whom
            (be those <span about="#i" property="doap:audience">individuals</span>, <span about="#i" property="doap:audience">organizations</span>, <span about="#i" property="doap:audience">applications</span>, etc.), and can revoke access at any time.</p>
        <p>To store and access data in a Pod, Solid-enabled <span about="#i" property="doap:category">applications</span> use standard, open, and interoperable
            data formats and protocols.</p>

          <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
            <p>Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid Pod — from structured data to files that one might
                store in a Google Drive or Dropbox folder.</p>
            <p>What makes Solid special is the ability to store data in a way that promotes interoperability.
                Specifically, Solid supports storing Linked Data. Structuring data as Linked Data means that
                different applications can work with the same data.</p>

          <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
            <img alt="interoperability-tour" src="image/interoperability-tour.svg" />
            <p>All data in a Solid Pod is stored and accessed using standard, open, and interoperable data
                formats and protocols. Solid uses a common, shared way of describing things and their
                relationships to one another that different applications can understand. This gives Solid the
                unique ability to allow different applications to work with the same data.</p>

            <img alt="interoperability-tour" src="image/solid-pod-tour.svg" />
            <p>With Solid's Authentication and Authorization systems, one can determine which people and
                applications can access their data. Entities can grant or revoke access to any slice of
                their data as needed. Consequently, entities can do more with their data, because the
                applications they decide to use can be granted access to a wider and more diverse set of
                information.</p>
            <p>And just as one can share their data with others, others can also share their data in return.
                This creates rich and collaborative experiences across a combination of both personal and
                shared data.</p>
