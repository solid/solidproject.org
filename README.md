## How to contribute

You can run `npx serve` in your local checkout of this repository to see your changes.

If you just want to propose small textual changes you can also create a PR through GitHub's
online editor.

The filenames should be intuitive enough for you to search for the HTML text that corresponds to the section
you want to edit.

If you state in your PR description that you had trouble setting up your local environment,
and then a Solid Team member will check and fix the layout for you if necessary, before merging your PR.

This way anyone who understands HTML and who has a GitHub account can suggest improvements for our website.
