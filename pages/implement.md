Are you in the business of apps, identification, or storage and interested in implementing Solid? 

We would love to hear about your specific needs and set up a call to talk about how to transition your existing code towards being Solid compliant. 

Let us know when you would be available via [info@solidproject.org](mailto:info@solidproject.org) and you will receive the dial in details and confirmation time.

You can read more about Solid on the webpage and in depth FAQs in preparation. If you have any material on your needs please do send them over so we can understand the details in more depth before our call. 

You can find other companies and organisations who have [implemented Solid here]({{site.baseUrl}}/use-solid).
