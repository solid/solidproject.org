## How can I get involved?

Solid is a burgeoning technology that is already being applied in the
real-world to solve practical problems, introducing exciting 
new ways for people to control their data and extract value from it.

The Solid ecosystem evolves and expands thanks to the efforts of the
Solid Community. Check out some of the [applications](/apps) created by
the community as well as some of the exciting work underway in several
