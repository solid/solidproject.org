## How can I get involved?

Solid is a burgeoning technology that is already being applied in the
real-world to solve practical problems, introducing exciting 
new ways for people to control their data and extract value from it.

The Solid ecosystem evolves and expands thanks to the efforts of the
Solid Community. Start by [getting a pod](/users/get-a-pod); 
try out some of the [applications](/apps) created by the community; 
and check out some of the exciting work underway in several
prestigious [Research Labs](/labs) across the world. 
There is much more work to do, and many exciting problems left to
solve. We invite and encourage you to join in!

**Engage with the Community!**  <br/>
Join the [Solid Project Forum](https://forum.solidproject.org),
and the [Solid Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/solid/chat); 
attend the monthly [Solid World](/events), and other events 
hosted across the world by community members. Sign up for the 
[This Month in Solid](https://solidproject.org/newsletter) newsletter.

**Do you feel like programming?** <br/>
[Learn to develop](/developers) Solid applications yourself,
or contribute to [existing tools and libraries](/developers/tools).

For organizations interested in how Solid can help address specific
problems or use cases, email the [Solid Team](/team) at
[info@solidproject.org](mailto:info@solidproject.org), and we'll be 
happy to provide some guidance.

### Contribute to the Specification

The Solid Specification consists of several 
[Technical Reports](/specification) (TR), each of which is edited by a 
[Solid panel](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/README.md#solid-panels).

**Engage with the Panels!** <br/>
Anyone can propose changes, identify problems, or suggest new 
use cases by filing an 
[issue via GitHub](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues), 
or by submitting 
[pull requests](https://github.com/solid/specification/pulls).

- **<u>User Stories</u>**: Anyone is free to submit new User Stories to 
  the [Solid User Stories](https://github.com/solid/user-stories/) 
  repository. They are tagged according to the aspects of Solid 
  that are relevant to them, so that specification panels can easily 
  find them for the work items at hand.

- **<u>Use Cases and Requirements</u>** (UCR): Based on the User Stories, 
  extensive Use Cases are formulated for each TR. 

  * [Authorization UCR](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/)
  * [Notifications UCR](https://solid.github.io/notifications-panel/notifications-ucr/)
  * Upcoming: WebID-Profile UCR ([issue](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/issues/55),
    [PR](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/80))

  These Use Cases and Requirements are reviewed by the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team 
  ([DEIT](https://github.com/solid/deit/blob/main/meetings/2021-11-09.md#deit-to-review-use-cases-in-specification-development)).

- **<u>Panel Meetings</u>**: Anyone can join the 
  [Solid panel meetings](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/README.md#solid-panels)
  to listen, provide insight or suggest topics for discussion. 
  Meeting schedules, agendas and minutes can be found on the GitHub 
  pages of each 
  [panel](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/README.md#solid-panels). 
  Please read the 
  [guidelines for participation](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/README.md)
  before calling in.

#### The Solid Process

All proposals undergo an Editorial review process. 
For more information on proposal submissions and reviews, see the 
[Solid Process](https://github.com/solid/process).
The document also describes stakeholders in the specification process, 
describes how to document use cases, and encourages adherence to the W3C's 
[Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/), 
specifically the [Priority of Constituencies](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies). 
This principle basically states that users always come as a first consideration, 
i.e. we look at what users need before thinking of what other stakeholders might need.
