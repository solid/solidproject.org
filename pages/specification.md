# Specification

The Solid Specification consists of several [Technical Reports](https://solidproject.org/TR/), each of which is edited by a 
[Solid panel](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/README.md#solid-panels).

Anyone can contribute by filing an [issue via GitHub](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues) 
or by submitting [pull requests](https://github.com/solid/specification/pulls).

Present your proposals via the most relevant meetings 
and communication channels: 

- Submit new **<u>User Stories</u>** to 
  the [Solid User Stories](https://github.com/solid/user-stories/) 
  repository. They are tagged according to the aspects of Solid 
  that are relevant to them, so that specification panels can easily 
  find them for the work items at hand.

- Help formulate **<u>Use Cases and Requirements</u>** (UCR) based on the User Stories for each TR: 

  * [Authorization UCR](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/)
  * [Notifications UCR](https://solid.github.io/notifications-panel/notifications-ucr.html)
  * Upcoming: WebID-Profile UCR ([issue](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/issues/55),
    [PR](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/80))

  All Solid UCRs are reviewed by the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team 
  ([DEIT](https://github.com/solid/deit/blob/main/meetings/2021-11-09.md#deit-to-review-use-cases-in-specification-development)).

- Join the Solid [Panel Meetings](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/README.md#solid-panels)
  to listen, provide insight or suggest topics for discussion. 
  Meeting schedules, agendas and minutes can be found on the GitHub 
  pages of each panel. 
  Please read the 
  [guidelines for participation](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/README.md)
  before calling in.
