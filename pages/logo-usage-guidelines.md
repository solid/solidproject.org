# Introduction

These guidelines are to help you when representing the Solid brand in apps, communications, content, events, projects or assets. They incorporate guidance for visual elements such as logos, colours, typography, iconography and graphic devices. There is also guidance for writing such as tone and format. These guidelines are intended for digital application.

Why do we need brand guidelines?
-
As a defined entity, Solid has an identity. The more consistent that identity is the easier it is to be identified and identify with. While the Solid brand may appear in a range of different places for very different purposes, by following these guidelines you will be helping to retain that consistency and build a stronger identity.

For app developers
-
Please use these guidelines for any instances where you are looking to reference Solid. In particular, please pay notice to the guidelines on logo and colour usage as well as how to refer to Solid and its key elements in text.

For event organisers or communications/content creators
-
If you are looking to create Solid communications, collateral or content please follow all aspects of these guidelines.

# Written tone

When writing for Solid communications or content you should look to adhere to the following tone of voice principles:

Clear
-
Being instantly understood by anyone, be they technically-minded or not, is fundamental to ensuring Solid meets its core values (see above). This means describing things in terms everyone will understand and avoiding jargon or ambiguous abbreviation/acronyms. Any  terminology which isnâ€™t in the vocabulary of the majority of people.

Honest
-
Being true to what anything is and what it delivers is key to ensuring Solid always remains genuine and trustworthy. Avoid using any embellishment or describing Solid in excessively glowing terms. Accuracy of information is also key to achieving this and the integrity of what Solid says should be protected at all times. Solid should be candid with the truth but at the same time avoid being frank or outspoken.

Open
-
Solid should always be welcoming and approachable in its tone and language - anyone should be made to feel like they can be part of the community. It should always be generous with what it shares and never feel like it is withholding information. Solid should avoid doctrine and being overly-directive in favour of offering guidance and advice.
___

# Written format

**Solid** and **Pod** should always be always be capitalised and never written in all-caps.

**WebID** is semi-capitalised. 

General writing should always be sentence case and avoid all non-standard capitalisation. For example, 'internet' and 'web' are decapitalised . 

British spelling, the serial comma, and the generic 'they' is used to specify a person of unknown gender on the website copy and mailing list.
