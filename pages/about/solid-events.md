Solid Events are an opportunity for the Solid community to meet in person locally. 


# Upcoming events

(past events are [listed below](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-events.md#past-events))

Solid Events are run by members of the Solid community like you. Here you can 
find a comprehensive guide to help you along the way. Reach out to the Solid 
Manager to set up a call and brainstorm the organisation of your event. 

# Solid Event Triplet 
A Solid Event triplet is a series of three events in the same city designed to have incremental engagement with your local network. 

1.	Meet and Greet 
Holding an informal meetup in a city is a good way to find out who else is working on Solid locally. 

A general introduction to Solid to kickstart your Solid Event can be helpful for 
newcomers and to warm the attention of the crowd. If your event is general and 
targeted to a wide audience using Solid or looking to use Solid, it is important 
that you cover What, Why, How, When, described so anyone can understand. It is 
useful to talk about the core values that define the Solid design. Value based 
conversations can be an excellent route to moving these conversations forward. 
Questions to answer in the opening introduction include: 
* What is Solid? 
* Why should I use Solid?
* How can I use Solid?

The [FOSDEM talk by Ruben Verborgh](http://bofh.nikhef.nl/events/FOSDEM/2019/Janson/solid_web_decentralization.mp4) 
is a great introduction if you'd prefer to screen a recording. 

Demos of Solid solutions preferably by locals building on Solid help the audience 
focus on practical implementations. You can also ask Solid app developers for 
recorded demos. 

At the end of the first Solid Event it’s a good idea to announce your local Solid Challenge. A Solid Challenge is a small aim where individuals or groups can aim towards and compete. Try and design the Solid Challenge to be relevant to the local setting. Perhaps you want to gauge the temperature at the first event and collect contact details of those interested in a Solid Challenge rather than announcing it immediately. Either way, make sure to follow up with a written description of the Solid Challenge aim as well as the prize criteria and the jury. Partnering with a local university is a good way to engage with student activity and the incorporate Solid into the local academic training. 

2.	Solid Challenge Prize Ceremony 

Set a date for the second Solid Event where you can announce the winner. This is a good opportunity to invite local businesses and institutions who may be interested in implementing Solid with the people who engaged in the Solid Challenge. 

Having speakers at the second Solid Event who can introduce Solid to businesses is helpful. 

3.	Company and Institutional demonstrations 
The third Solid Event is a good place to gather local companies and institutuions who have been working on implementing Solid. The first demonstrations are likely to be early stage which is helpful so that you can understand how best to complement and support each other. 

## Speakers 
Solid Events are a great opportunity to highlight local people building on Solid. 
Reach out to the Solid Team and ask  solid/chat on gitter to see if there are 
people local to you. 

## Debate Panel  
If you decide to set up a debate panel, define a theme or opening question. One 
way to focus the conversation is to set it up as a debate panel with multiple 
teams defending a specific perspective. Allocating people to defend perspectives 
they do not necessarily agree with is a good way to open the mind and expand 
the debate.

## Entrepreneur-Investor Pitching 
One format is to invite local entrepreneurs and developers to pitch an idea 
for a Solid app or Pod Provider. You can also invite investors to pitch why 
their funds are appropriate for Solid values.

## Hackathons 
Hackathons are great for passing on knowledge between those who are familiar 
with Solid to those who are learning. It is useful to have a concrete target 
for your hackathon that you can work towards together. There is a collection 
of educational materials available at [Solid Teaching Materials](resources.md).

# Team 
A good team can make all the difference. Examples of roles include: 
- promotion 
- ticketing 
- equipment support 
- presentation host

# Venue
Partnering with existing meetups or organisations that regularly host events has 
the benefit of learning from their experience and benefit from their existing 
setup. Make sure to select a venue that can accommodate the number of people 
you expect with sufficient tables and chairs. 

# Equipment
Organising a projector, sound system, and laptop for displaying the presentation 
in advance is important for a smooth running event. Make sure you have the right 
cables and preferably do a trial run before the event. If you partner with a venue 
that is familiar with hosting events, make sure to know who to contact about 
equipment setup. 

# Invitation 
Eventbrite and Meetup provide invitation services that have been popular with 
Solid Event Organisers. A standard Solid Event invite text could be:
