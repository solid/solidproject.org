# Origin

Solid is a mid-course correction for the Web by its inventor, 
[Sir Tim Berners-Lee](/team). It realizes Tim's original vision for the 
Web as a medium for the secure, decentralized exchange of public 
and private data.

## Why fix the Web?

The [first web browser](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/) was also an editor. 
The idea being that not only could everyone read content on the web, but 
they could also help create it. It was 
to be a collaborative space for everyone.

However, when the first browser that popularized the web came along, called 
Mosaic, it included multimedia and editing was taken out. It was considered 
too difficult a problem. This change was the first curtailing of the web’s 
promise and spawned an effort led by Tim and others to get the write 
functionality back. It was dubbed the ‘read-write web’ and led to Richard 
McManus' 
[seminal article](https://web.archive.org/web/20181214015324/http://readwrite.com/2003/04/19/the_readwrite_w) 
published in 2003.

The issue with writing data, as Wikipedia and others have learned, is that you 
need a degree of control over who can write what. That means you need to have 
permissions to dictate what individuals can do to the data. And to have 
permissions you need to have a system for identity - a way of uniquely 
authenticating that an individual is who they purport to be.

Of course the social networks solved this problem within their own systems 
using their own specific identity and access control, but these were not 
standard, not interoperable, and gave you no choice in what applications you
could use to access that data. You had to have your entire personal
or professional life within one silo for it to work. And since the Web
is ubiquitous, these silos exist across the data spectrum, from social
and medical to financial and civil. 

When your data is siloed away from you:

* You have hardly any visibility into what is being retained.
* You have little control over how it is used, or who is using it. 
* You have little choice in which applications you can use to access it.
* It is hard to use as a cohesive unit, specifically because it is siloed,
scattered across proprietary vendors, interfaces, and data formats.

All of these factors combine to make it very hard to access all of your
own data, and put it to work on your behalf.
