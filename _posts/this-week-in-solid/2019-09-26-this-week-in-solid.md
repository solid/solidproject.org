# 26th September 2019

Hello and welcome to another edition of *This Week in Solid*!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org/information/) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along. If you have a suggestion on how to improve this description you may be interested in [joining the Explaining the Vision panel](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md#explaining-the-vision-panel) who are working on describing [Solid in a Nutshell](https://github.com/solid/Explaining-the-Vision-Panel).

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org or [send a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome](https://github.com/solid/information#develop).

This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/solid/information/edit/master/weekly-updates/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Weekly Solid Call
Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid. This week Jim, Alessandra, Dan, Michiel, Jackson, Justin, and Dmitri tuned in and we had a round of introductions. Then we talked through the activity in the panels this week which included: data interoperability, authorisation and access control, and authentication. The [issues on the specficiation respository](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues) define the scope of work that needs to be done, there was an invitation to read through these, comment and add any issues that you feel are missing. 

Next weeks call will be on the 3rd October at 1000CEST on [this line](https://zoom.us/j/121552099).

## Solid Implementation

If you have any new [apps](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps), [Pods](https://github.com/solid/pods), or [identity providers](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list), or there are updates to existing Solid implementations, make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next week's edition.

* The [brand new version 0.9 of **Startin’blox**](https://git.happy-dev.fr/startinblox/framework/sib-core) is out in beta this week ! This version includes **Ld-flex**, the store that allows the app to get data on the server. This is the **second Solid library** that has been integrated into **Startin’blox** after **Solid-auth**. **Thousand thanks to Ruben and his teammates**, for their initiatives and contributions. 

## Solid Development
The scope of work that needs to happen on the Solid specification has been written down as issues which you can read [here](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues). If you feel something is missing from the scope of the Solid specification [submit an issue](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues). On Friday the [editors](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/editors.md) will define which issues to include in the [milestone](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/1) to be delivered on December 19th which will define the focus of work until then.

Panel work included: 
* [Data Interoperability - use case](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/49bf3b2debfbe20af6fe97b9fc0dee4b9558300c/user-profile/use-cases.md) where feedback is very welcome
