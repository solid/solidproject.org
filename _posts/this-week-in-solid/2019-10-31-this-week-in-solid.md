# 31st October 2019

Hello and welcome to another edition of *This Week in Solid*!

If you are familiar with this newsletter you can [skip directly to updates](##updates).

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org. This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/weekly-updates/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls). 

Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome.](https://github.com/solid/process)
