## Updates

### [Events](https://solidproject.org/events)

Solid Events are open gatherings for anyone interested in Solid; run and organised by people like you. While these events used to happen in person in cities around the world, Solid Events are moving online for the foreseeable future in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Solid World is an opportunity to meet people who are working on or interested in working on Solid.

[Read more about Solid World April](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/solid-world-tickets-100417571660) which is happening this Thursday 2nd at 1600 CEST.

If you have any questions for the presenters [pop them in this thread](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/solid-world-april-2020/2788).

Are you interested in speaking about what you have been building on Solid? Reach out to the Solid Manager on info@solidproject.org to get a speaking slot at the next event.

### Covid-19 Hackathon

Come take part in the MIT Covid-19 Hackathon on the 3rd April until 5th April. This is a great opportunity to share Solid expertise and values and apply them to an urgent and humanitarian use case. Solid was born out of a MIT project, so it’s fitting for us to contribute to this hackathon. Hope to see you there next weekend!

## Solid Implementation

If you have any new [apps](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps), [Pods](https://github.com/solid/pods), or [identity providers](https://github.com/solid/solid-idp-list), or there are updates to existing Solid implementations, make sure to add them to the list so they get included in next week's edition.
