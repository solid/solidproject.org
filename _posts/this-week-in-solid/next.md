### Solidproject.org

The landing page has been redesigned, and most other pages have received a small touch-up. Additionally, most content has undergone editing to ensure the information is relevant and free of typos. All in all, the starting point for all things Solid should be more pleasant to use now.

### [Developer Tools](https://solidproject.org/for-developers/apps/tools)
* [Mark Hughes](https://github.com/theWebalyst) is working on [showing how to use various RDF libs with Sveltejs](https://github.com/theWebalyst/svelte-with-rdf-libs-webpack) and has rdflib.js and graphy working
* [Jeff Zucker](https://github.com/jeff-zucker), [Alain Bourgeois](https://github.com/bourgeoa), and [Otto_AA](https://github.com/Otto-AA) released **[version 1.0.0 of Solid-File-Client](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client)**, a library of methods to manage Solid files and folders that now has the ability to copy and move entire folder trees from one pod to another or back and forth between a pod and a local file system. It supports both text and binary files and works in either a browser or node/console context. Also new in this version is extensive support for linked resources (.acl and .meta files). [Read the release announcement.](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/announce-major-new-version-of-solid-shell/2561)
*  [Jeff Zucker](https://github.com/jeff-zucker) also released a major new version of **[Solid-Shell](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-shell)**, a tool for handling Solid files and folders from the command-line, in an interactive shell, and using batch-processing. You can automate and test tasks with robust error logging options. Solid Shell is built on top of Solid-File-Client and is therefore able to handle uploading, downloading, copying, moving, linked resources (.acl,.meta) and other Solid-specific features.
