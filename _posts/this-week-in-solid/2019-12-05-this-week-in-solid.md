Hello and welcome to another edition of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org. This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](http://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/master/_posts/this-week-in-solid/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls).
