<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>
<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>
<p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>. If you find any errors in this month’s issue please <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>

<h2>Culture Conversations</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/solid/process/pulls">several process proposals</a> to which you can suggest improvements.</p>
<p>You can apply to roles by submitting a pull request to the .md file of the role you are applying to in the culture repository. You can view the open <a href="https://github.com/solid/process/pulls">applications to roles</a>.</p>
