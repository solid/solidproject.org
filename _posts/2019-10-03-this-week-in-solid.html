<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>
<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>
<p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>. If you find any errors in this month’s issue please <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>
<h2>Weekly Solid Call</h2>
<p>Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid. This week was a general conversation about open source Solid servers. Next weeks call will be cancelled so the next call will be on the 17th October at 1000 CEST on <a href="https://zoom.us/j/121552099">this line</a>.</p>
