## Updates

### [Events](https://solidproject.org/events)

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic Solid Events are moving online for the foreseeable future.

The first online [Solid World](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/solid-world-tickets-100417571660) will be on the 2nd of April 2020 at 1600 CEST.  [Tune in](https://zoom.us/j/606342071) for two Solid app presentations by the people behind the apps. Solid World is a great opportunity to connect to other Solid app developers.
