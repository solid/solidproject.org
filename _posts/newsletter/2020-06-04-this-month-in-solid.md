## Updates

### [Events](https://solidproject.org/events)

Solid World is an opportunity to meet people who are interested in or currently working on Solid.

This month the theme of Solid World was geolocation and Sharon Stratsianis kicked off with a talk on the benefits of Geolocation on Solid. The capstone project of her Masters of Information Technology and Distributed Computing at Melbourne University was on Semantic Web and Location Privacy.

Associate Professor [Jose Emilio Labra Gayo](http://labra.weso.es/) directs the Web Semantics Reseach Group (WESO) at the Univesity of Oviedo. He explained how he taught approximately one hundred second year bachelor of engineering students how to build Solid apps and explained the course assignments the students were given.

In the third talk, Ángel Maldonado, founder and CEO of Empathy.co, introduced Empathy's vision for decentralised commerce, as a platform that serves the consumers and not the brands, one that tracks, locates and profiles the store at the service of the consumer as well as the ongoing with work the University of Oviedo. Empathy serves brands such as Inditex, Kroger or Carrefour to connect with their consumers, humanly through Search, Navigation and UI Componentry.

Following the three talks there was the prize ceremony. You can watch the videos and see the code of the [entries for the Solid Geolocation challenge](https://arquisoft.github.io/course1920.html#SolidChallen2020).
