# Running your own Solid server

A Solid server allows you to register for a Pod and a WebID.
<br>
You can either [use a publicly available server](/users/get-a-pod)
or follow the steps on this page to set up your own.

The following **open-source servers** are available:

- [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/) for Node.js
- [Node Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server) for Node.js
- [solid-nextcloud](https://github.com/pdsinterop/solid-nextcloud) as a plugin for Nextcloud
- [PHP Solid Server](https://github.com/pdsinterop/php-solid-server) for PHP

And the following **commercial servers** are available:

- [Enterprise Solid Server by Inrupt](https://inrupt.com/products/enterprise-solid-server/)
- [TrinPod by Graphmetrix](https://graphmetrix.com/construction/trinpod)

We walk you through the installation of the Community Solid Server below.
<br>
We also provide [Instructions for Node Solid Server](/self-hosting/nss).

# Running the Community Solid Server {#running-css}

To run the Community Solid Server,
you can choose between:

- [Node.js](#nodejs)
- [Docker](#docker)

## Via Node.js and npm {#nodejs}

Ensure you have [installed Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
We support versions 12.7 and up,
but recommend 14 or 16.
<br>
To **install the server**, open a command prompt and type:

```shell
npm install -g @solid/community-server
```

To **run the server** with in-memory storage, type:

```shell
community-solid-server
```

To run the server with **file-based storage**, type:

```shell
community-solid-server -c @css:config/file.json
```

You can now [access your server](#access) locally.

## Via Docker {#docker}

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) allows you to run the server
without having Node.js installed:

```shell
# Clone the repo to get access to the configs
git clone https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer.git
cd CommunitySolidServer
# Run the image, serving your `~/Solid` directory on `http://localhost:3000`
docker run --rm -v ~/Solid:/data -p 3000:3000 -it solidproject/community-server:latest
# Or use one of the built-in configurations
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -it solidproject/community-server -c config/default.json
# Or use your own configuration mapped to the right directory
docker run --rm -v ~/solid-config:/config -p 3000:3000 -it solidproject/community-server -c /config/my-config.json
```

## Accessing your server {#access}

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
You will be greeted by a welcome page.

This welcome page is hosted on a _root Pod_,
to which **you and your apps can read and write**.

## Creating your own account {#account}

To create your own account,
visit [http://localhost:3000/idp/register/](http://localhost:3000/idp/register/).
<br>
The server can then **host your Pod and WebID**.

## Extending your server

The Community Solid Server is highly modular
and supports many different configurations and plugins.

The [Recipes](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/Recipes)
contain a couple of examples to get started.

These are some plugins you can add to your server:

- [Dgraph backend](https://github.com/comake/solid-dgraph)
- [Redis backend](https://github.com/comake/solid-redis)
- [Philips Hue backend](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/solid-hue)

## Exposing your server publicly {#public}

The Solid server will run as a local Web server.
You can expose the server directly
either by running it on a public port
or by placing it behind a _reverse proxy_.

When going public,
be sure to tell the server its base URL via the `-b` flag:

```shell
community-solid-server -b https://server.example/
```

Here are instructions to set up common proxy servers:

- [NGINX](/for-developers/pod-server/nginx)
- [Apache](/for-developers/pod-server/apache)

## Feedback and questions {#feedback}

If you have feedback or questions about the server,
don't hesitate to [start a discussion](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/discussions)
or [report a bug](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/issues).
