# Building your first Solid app

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Build the Application](#build-the-application)
- [Run the Application](#run-the-application)

This tutorial creates an introductory application that uses Inrupt's
[JavaScript Client Libraries](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-js) to read
and write your name to your user profile.

Note: Although this tutorial uses Inrupt's JavaScript libraries, you can use other libraries (be it for JavaScript or other languages) that support Solid. For more information, see the [Solid Developer Tools & Libraries](https://solidproject.org/developers/tools/).

This tutorial uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
to run the application locally on `localhost:1234`.

> You can also try out the application in CodeSandbox.

>
> Inside CodeSandbox, rather than running the application in the embedded browser, open the application in a new window to be able to log in.

## Prerequisites

### Your own Pod and WebID

Before you start,
make sure you have [your own Pod and WebID](/developers/tutorials/getting-started).

### Install `npm`

If you don't already have `npm` installed, follow the appropriate instructions
at the [Get npm!](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) site. `npm` is installed as part of the
Node.js installation.

## Build the Application

### 1. Initialize the Application

1. Create a directory for the application:

   ```shell
   mkdir my-demo-app
   ```

1. Go into the newly created directory:

   ```shell
   cd my-demo-app
   ```

1. Create a brand new application (Omit the `--yes` to override the default values):

   ```shell
   npm init --yes
   ```

### 2. Install the Inrupt Client Libraries

Use `npm` to install Inrupt client libraries:

```shell
npm install @inrupt/solid-client @inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser @inrupt/vocab-common-rdf
```

### 3. Install Parcel

1. Use `npm` to install `Parcel`:

   ```shell
   npm install parcel-bundler
   ```

1. Edit the `package.json` file to list the browsers supported by
   this application. Specifically, add the `browserslist` field and value:

   > **TIP:** Be sure to add the comma after the preceding field before adding
   > the `browserslist` field.

   ```shell
   "dependencies": {
      ...
   },
   "browserslist": [
     "last 3 and_chr versions",
     "last 3 chrome versions",
     "last 3 opera versions",
     "last 3 ios_saf versions",
     "last 3 safari versions",
     "last 3 edge versions"
   ]
   ```

   Without the `browserslist` specification, Parcel would need to
   inject a compatibility layer to avoid a `regeneratorRuntime` reference error
   since our sample application uses `async` functions.

   As an alternative to modifying the `package.json` file, you could import
   `regenerator-runtime/runtime` in your JavaScript code, which will inject a
   suitable compatibility layer.

### 4. Create the Application

In the `my-demo-app` directory, create the files for the application.

1. Create a `my-demo.css` file with the following content:

   ```css

   {% include_relative codesandbox/my-demo.css %}

   ```

1. Create an `index.html` file with the following content:

   ```html
   {% include_relative codesandbox/index.html %}
   ```

1. Create an `index.js` file with the following content:

   > **NOTE:** If your Pod is not on `https://solidcommunity.net`, modify the
   > value of the `SOLID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` variable accordingly.

   ```javascript

   {% include_relative codesandbox/index.js %}

   ```

## Run the Application

1. In the `my-demo-app` directory, run:

   ```shell
   npx parcel index.html
   ```

   The output should resemble the following:

   ```shell
     Server running at http://localhost:1234
     ...
     Built in 2ms.
   ```

1. Open `localhost:1234` in a browser.

1. Click the `Login` button.

   - The first time you log into your Pod with this application (it'll
     be named `http://localhost:1234`), you'll
     be prompted to authorize it to access your Pod . To allow the application to
     read and write to your Pod, click `Authorize`.

   - If you have logged out of your Pod, you are prompted to log in.
     Enter your username and password to log in.

   - Once logged in, you should be redirected back to the client application.

     Back in the application, you should see a message stating `Your session is logged in with the WebID [<your WebID>].` and the WebID textfield should display your WebID.

1. Now that you're logged in, you can read and write the information in
   your Solid profile.

   1. First, click the `Read Profile` button.

      You should see the name you entered when you registered your Pod.

   1. To update your name, enter a new name in the `2. Write your name`
      textfield, and click the `Write to Profile` button. You should see the message:

      ```
      Wrote [<your new name>] as name successfully!
      ```

   1. Verify that your profile was updated by clicking on
      the `Read Profile` button again. You should see the updated name displayed!

   You can also read the public profiles of anyone else in the world with a
   Solid Pod. Enter the WebID of the person whose profile you wish to read;
   e.g., `https://docs-example.inrupt.net/profile/card#me`.

1. Exit the Application. To exit the application, stop the `npx parcel` process; e.g.,
   `Ctrl-C`.
