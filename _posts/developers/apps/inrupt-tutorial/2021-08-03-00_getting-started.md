# Getting started as a Solid developer
To get started with Solid,
you will need a **Solid Pod** and a **WebID**.
<br>
You can create one for yourself,
or you can create multiple test accounts for experimentation.

You basically have two broad kinds of options:
1. You create aÂ Solid Pod with an [existing provider](#existing-provider).
2. You set up [your own server](#own-server).

## Using an existing Pod provider {#existing-provider}
Various [Solid Pod providers](/users/get-a-pod#get-a-pod-from-a-pod-provider) exist.
To ensure your server is working with the latest version of Solid,
we recommend one of these servers:

- [Inrupt Pod Spaces](https://signup.pod.inrupt.com/)
- _more to be added soon_

## Running your own server {#own-server}
Several **open-source Solid servers** are available
to run on your own machine.

[Read more](/self-hosting) on how to get them up and running.

## Developing your first app
Once you are set up with your own Pod and WebID,
you're ready to start [developing your own app](/developers/tutorials/first-app).
