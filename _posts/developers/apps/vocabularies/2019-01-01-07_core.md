The following vocabularies are essential, because they describe... vocabularies. Let's get meta for a moment.

# <a id='rdf'/> RDF

## Prefix and namespace
- rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

## Description

RDF and RDFS are the foundation on which all other vocabularies are built. They enable the description of a graph of [rdfs:Resources](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource), each identified by an IRI.

RDF graphs are based on the notion of [rdf:statement](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement): a statement can be compared to a very simple sentence <subject, verb, complement>, e.g. `Charlie is a Person`. In the RDF terminology, we say that an [rdf:statement](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Statement) has an [rdf:subject](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#subject) (the resource the statement is about), an [rdf:property](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#property) (the verb of the sentence, defining a characteristic of the subject) and an [rdf:object](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#object) (the value for the property for the subject). Therefore, the sentence `Charlie is a Person` could be expressed in RDF as `[ex](http://example.org/ns#):Charlie rdf:type [ex](http://example.org/ns#):Person`, where `<http://example.org/ns#Charlie>` is the subject, `rdf:type` the property, and `<http://example.org/ns#Person>` the object. Subject and predicate are necessarily individuals identified with an IRI, while the object is either an individual with an IRI, or a literal with a value (e.g. string or int).

## Main concepts

- Typing a Resource: `<resource IRI> rdf:type <type IRI>`, where the type is an [rdfs:class](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class)

# <a id='rdfs'/> RDFS

## Prefix and namespace
- rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#

## Description

RDFS enables to build hierarchies of concepts by introducing the notion of [rdfs:class](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class), and the [rdfs:subClassOf](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf) property. Similarly, [rdf:properties](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property) can be organized hierarchically by using the [rdfs:subPropertyOf](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subPropertyOf) property. RDFS also enables describing the types that can be attached to [rdfs:resources](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource) when they are associated with an [rdf:property](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property) by specifying the property's [rdfs:domain](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain) (the type of its subject) and [rdfs:range](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range) (the type of the object). For instance, let's imagine `ex:hasAuthor`, a property expressing the fact that someone is the author of a book. If we state that `ex:hasAuthor rdfs:domain ex:Book` and that `ex:hasAuthor rdfs:range ex:Person`, effectively what we say is that anytime we find a statement such as `ex:aBook ex:hasAuthor ex:someone`, we know that `ex:aBook` is of type `ex:Book`, and that `ex:someone` is a `ex:Person`

## Main concepts

- Subclassing: `<subclass IRI> rdfs:subClassOf <class IRI>`
- Specifying a property's domain: `<property IRI> rdfs:domain <type IRI>`
- Specifying a property's range: `<property IRI> rdfs:range <type IRI>`
- Adding a human-readable name to a concept identified by an IRI: `<IRI> rdfs:label "Some name"`
- Adding a longer comment describing a concept: `<IRI> rdfs:comment "Some comment"`
- Redirecting to another information source: `<IRI> rdfs:seeAlso <IRI>`

# <a id='owl'/> OWL
