## Description

Used in the Solid WebID Profile spec for discovery of user account resources (to link to Root Storage and Preferences resources). This ontology is for use in describing Workspaces. Workspaces are place where data is stored and associated policies of privacy. A given application typically stores information in several different workspaces, some being user private, some shared, and some public. It is crucial that the user has easy control over the destiny of information.

Goals then are that the user can:

- create workspaces
- easily understand which workspace data is going into
- understand what the implications of that are
- (later) set ACLs on them
- publish appropriate use policies for them
