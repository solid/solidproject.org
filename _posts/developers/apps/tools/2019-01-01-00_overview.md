# Solid Developer Tools & Libraries

There are a number of robust developer libraries to save you from re-inventing the wheel.  Everyone is invited to contribute new libraries and provide feedback on existing libraries - see [how to contribute](#contribute).  

## <a name="tools">Solid-specific Tools</a>
  * [Molid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/molid) - a mock server that can be used for testing apps
  * [Penny](https://penny.vincenttunru.com/) - a file manager for Solid pods
  * [Shighl](https://github.com/scenaristeur/shighl) - a tool that lets your write simply HTML/JavaScript to interact with a Solid Pod Session, Profile, Inbox, Chat...
Session, Profile, Inbox, Chat...
  * [SolidOS Databrowser](https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos) - The operating system for Solid
  * [Solid Data Kitchen](https://github.com/solidos/data-kitchen) - The solid databrowser technology as a stand-alone electron app
  * [Solid Filemanager](https://github.com/Otto-AA/solid-filemanager) - a file manager for Solid pods
  * [Solid IDE](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-ide) - GUI front-end for Solid document management and syntax-highlighting pod editor
  * [Solid Shell](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-shell) - command line, interactive shell, and batch processor for Solid document management
  * [PodOS Browser](https://browser.pod-os.org) - Browse and manage things in a Solid pod


## <a name="libraries">Solid-specific JavaScript Libraries</a>

A typical Solid app will perform one or more of these functions using one of the associated libraries:

* login & manage sessions ([Authentication Libraries](#authentication))
* parse & query linked data  ([Linked Data Libraries](#linked_data))
* manage documents and information flow ([Resource Management Libraries](#resource))
* provide a user interface ([Interface Libraries](#interface))

Beginning developers may want to start with one of the interface libraries which provide pre-built components.  Advanced developers might want to look at [Low Level Libraries](#low_level) and/or participate in the [Solid OS project](#solidos).
