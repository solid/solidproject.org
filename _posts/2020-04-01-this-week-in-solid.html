<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<h2><a href="https://solidproject.org/events">Events</a></h2>
<p>Solid Events are open gatherings for anyone interested in Solid; run and organised by people like you. While these events used to happen in person in cities around the world, Solid Events are moving online for the foreseeable future in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Solid World is an opportunity to meet people who are working on or interested in working on Solid.</p>

<h2>Covid-19 Hackathon</h2>
<p>Come take part in the MIT Covid-19 Hackathon on the 3rd April until 5th April. This is a great opportunity to share Solid expertise and values and apply them to an urgent and humanitarian use case. Solid was born out of an MIT project, so it’s fitting for us to contribute to this hackathon. Hope to see you there next weekend!</p>
