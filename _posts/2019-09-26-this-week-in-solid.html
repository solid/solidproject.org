<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!</p>
<p><a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a> is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.</p>
<p>This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.</p>
<p>Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at solid+info@theodi.org. This Month in Solid is openly developed <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/main/_posts/newsletter/next.md">on GitHub</a>. If you find any errors in this month's issue please <a href="https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls">submit a pull request</a>.</p>
<h2>Weekly Solid Call</h2>
<p>Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid. This week Jim, Alessandra, Dan, Michiel, Jackson, Justin, and Dmitri tuned in and we had a round of introductions. Then we talked through the activity in the panels this week which included: data interoperability, authorisation and access control, and authentication. The <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification/issues">issues on the specification respository</a> define the scope of work that needs to be done, there was an invitation to read through these, comment and add any issues that you feel are missing.</p>
<p>Next weeks call will be on the 3rd October at 1000 CEST on <a href="https://zoom.us/j/121552099">this line</a>.</p>
