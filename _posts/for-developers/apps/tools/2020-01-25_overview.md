# Solid Tools and Libraries

The basic building blocks for developing Solid apps include [tools](#tools) - software that supports development without programming - and [libraries](#libraries) - collections of methods which can be used to buid apps.  Everyone is invited to [contribute new tools and libraries](#contribute).

## <a name="tools">Solid-specific Tools</a>
  * [Molid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/molid) - a mock server that can be used for testing apps
  * [Solid Data Kitchen](https://github.com/solid/data-kitchen) - The solid databrowser technology as a stand-alone electron app
  * [Solid IDE](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client) - GUI front-end for Solid document management and syntax-highlighting pod editor
  * [Solid Local Pod Manager](https://github.com/otto-aa/solid-local-pod-manager) - serve parts of your local filesystem as a local pod
  * [Solid Shell](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-shell) - command line, interactive shell, and batch processor for Solid document management

## <a name="libraries">Solid-specific Javascript Libraries</a>

A typical Solid app will perform one or more of these functions using one of the associated libraries:

* login & manage sessions ([Authentication Libraries](#authentication))
* parse & query linked data  ([Linked Data Libraries](#linked_data))
* manage documents and information flow ([Resource Management Libraries](#resource))
* provide a user interface ([Interface Libraries](#interface))

Beginning developers may want to start with one of the interface libraries which provide pre-built components.  Advanced developers might want to look at [Low Level Libraries](#low_level).

  * <a name="authentication">**Authentication & Access Control Libraries**</a>
     * [ACL Check](https://github.com/solid/acl-check) - check Web Access Control ACLs
     * [Solid Auth Client](https://github.com/solid/solid-auth-client) - login and session management for browsers
     * [Solid Auth Cli](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-auth-cli) - login and session management for node/console

  * <a name="linked_data">**Linked Data Libraries**</a>
     * [LDflex for Solid](https://github.com/solid/query-ldflex)
     * [GraphQL-LD for Solid](https://github.com/rubensworks/graphql-ld-comunica-solid.js)
     * [rdflib](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/)
     * [rdf-ext](https://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-ext)
     * [Soukai-solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid)
     * [Tripledoc](https://vincenttunru.gitlab.io/tripledoc/)
     * [Shighl](https://github.com/scenaristeur/shighl)
