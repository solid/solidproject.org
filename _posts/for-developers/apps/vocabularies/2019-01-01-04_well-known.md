This page references vocabularies that are widely used, and that are likely to cover some aspects of your app:
- [Common vocabularies](#common) are all-purpose vocabularies solving everyday life issues (for app development)
- [Technical vocabularies](#technical) are vocabularies describing technical entities: HTTP messages, RSS feeds...
- [Core vocabularies](#core) are vocabularies used to build vocabularies.
- [Solid vocabularies](#solid) are vocabularies present in the Solid standard.
