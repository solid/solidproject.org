If you're here, it means that there are portions of your application that are covered by no existing vocabulary. If this is the case, you'll need to __build your own vocabulary__. Before getting started, let us remind you that the more existing vocabularies you reuse, the more reusable data from your app will be reusable by others. Therefore, a good thing to keep in mind is that your vocabulary should really be focused on a specific domain that you want to be able to describe, and for which nothing else exists.

To make things more hands-on, we'll see how [Cleopatra](https://cleopatra.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me) and [Caesar](https://jcaesar.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me) build an overly simplified obelisk vocabulary as a toy example.

1. If you are in a hurry:
- [Quickstart creation](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/create/quickstart): Build a vocabulary in 10 minutes
- [Quickstart usage](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/use/quickstart): Use this vocabulary to describe some data
- [Quickstart code](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/code/quickstart): Build a small app using your new vocabulary

2. If you have some more time
- Before implementing your own vocabulary, you might consider browsing these [best practices for building vocabularies](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/create/best-practices)
- [Extended creation](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/create/extended): Let us polish up the quickstart vocabulary to make it look even better by implementing these best practices
- For a more advanced tutorial, there exist [methodologies for building vocabularies](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/create/methodology)
- [Extended usage](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/use/extended): Describe your data and store it in a Solid pod

Once you have your vocabulary RDF and documentation, the next step is [publishing it](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/publish).
