The W3C issued some [recipes for publishing your vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/) that are a good complement to what is introduced here, as well as some more generic [good practices for HTTP resources](https://www.w3.org/TR/chips/).

## <a id="iri"/> Vocabulary IRI

One of the rules of [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData) is that things are named with IRI so that they can be looked up. Vocabularies are no exception, so __make sure yours has an IRI you control__. Your vocabulary should be accessible when looking up its IRI. There exists some recommendations to make sure the IRI you picked is [cool](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/):
1. Keep it __simple__: short, memorable IRI are less error-prone
2. Ensure __stability__ (remember: [cool IRI don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)). To this end, consider applying for a [w3id](https://w3id.org/), a permanent IRI that redirects to your own, less stable namespace.
3. Promote __manageability__ by using versioned IRI. The __W3C versioning__ approach is to ensure that the permanent IRI of a document always points to its latest version, and that each version has a specific IRI typically including its publication date or version number (referenced with the property [`owl:versionInfo`](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo)). Each version points to the previous one with an [`owl:priorVersion`](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#priorVersion) link, and the latest version includes a [`owl:versionIRI`](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionIRI) property indicating its versioned IRI. The [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) also provides versioning terms: [`terms:isReplacedBy`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/isReplacedBy) and [`terms:replaces`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/replaces) to connect versions to one another, [`terms:isVersionOf`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/isVersionOf) to connect version to the permanent IRI.

We already chose a w3id identifier for the webcomic vocabulary, so all we need to do is versioning, which could look like the following:

```
@prefix terms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>.

<http://w3id.org/webcomic/ns> rdf:type owl:Ontology ;
                               owl:versionInfo "0.1.0" ;
                               owl:versionIRI <http://w3id.org/webcomic/2019/10/09/ns> ;
                               owl:priorVersion <http://w3id.org/webcomic/2019/10/08/ns> ;
                               terms:isReplacedBy <http://w3id.org/webcomic/2019/10/08/ns> .
```

## Vocabulary metadata

We already described some meta that should be attached to a vocabulary when covering [documentation](/for-developers/apps/vocabularies/create/best-practices#vocab-doc) and versioning. Apart from versioning info and a human-readable description, the [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es) (a reference for vocabulary publication) recommends to add [additional metadata to a vocabulary](https://lov.linkeddata.es/Recommendations_Vocabulary_Design.pdf):
- A [voaf:preferredNamespaceUri](http://purl.org/vocommons/voaf#preferredNamespaceUri) to reference the preferred IRI of the vocabulary, e.g. its permanent IRI as opposed to its versioned ones.
- A [voaf:preferredNamespacePrefix](http://purl.org/vocommons/voaf#preferredNamespacePrefix) to indicate a short, convenient way of referencing your vocabulary instead of its IRI.
- A [terms:title](http://purl.org/dc/terms/title) and [terms:description](http://purl.org/dc/terms/description), which play the same role as [rdfs:label](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label) and [rdfs:comment](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label)
- In addition to the version information that we already mentionned (namely [`owl:versionInfo`](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo)), information about release dates with [terms:issued](http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued) for the initial release and [terms:modified](http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified) for the release of the current version
- Relevant information for authoring and intellectual property:
    - [terms:creator](http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator) and [terms:contributor](http://purl.org/dc/terms/contributor) the creator(s) and contributor(s) of the vocabulary. All the better if they have webid that can be linked to!
    - [terms:rights](http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights) or [cc:license](http://creativecommons.org/ns#licence) to describe the property rights or licence under which the vocabulary is available. Some widely used licenses are themselves identified by IRI, so you can directly reference them: [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license)...
    - [terms:publisher](http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher) the publisher of the vocabulary, e.g. when creators and contributors work as part of an organization.

Putting all together, the metadata of the webcomic vocabulary could look something like that:

```
@prefix cc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#> .
@prefix terms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix vann: <http://purl.org/vocab/vann/> .

<http://w3id.org/webcomic/ns> rdf:type owl:Ontology ;

                               terms:description """

    """ ;
                               vann:preferredNamespacePrefix "webco" ;
                               vann:preferredNamespaceURI <http://w3id.org/webcomic/ns> ;

                               # Version

                               owl:priorVersion <http://w3id.org/webcomic/2019/10/08/ns> ;
                               terms:isReplacedBy <http://w3id.org/webcomic/2019/10/08/ns>
                               owl:versionInfo "0.1.0" ;
                               terms:issued "52BC-01-01"
                               terms:modified "2019-10-09".
```

## Content negotiation

Now that you have an IRI, a vocabulary and its metadata, and its documentation (that you might want to regenerate to include the metadata), you're nearly there! The next step to publishing your vocabulary is setting up [content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation), so that your server serves tailored content depending on who asks. The first usage for this is to show, under the same IRI, documentation to humans and RDF to programs. If you exported your vocabulary in different RDF syntaxes, you can also use content negotiation to serve these different flavours to clients who specifically ask for one. The content negotiation mechanism also explains why we left the file extension out of the IRI: the resource identified by the IRI is not necessarily a single document.

Content negotiation is based on HTTP `Accept` headers:
- On `Accept: X`, X being a IANA MIME type for an RDF syntax (e.g. `text/turtle`, `application/rdf+xml`, `application/trig`, ` text/n3`, ` 	application/ld+json`...), serve the appropriate document
- On `Accept: Y`, Y being a IANA MIME type for human-readable text (e.g. `text/plain`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `text/html`...), serve the documentation
- If the client does not provide one, be sure to implement a default behavior, e.g. serving the Turtle document.

Here are specific instructions to set up content negotiation on some popular web servers:
- [nginx](https://pieterheyvaert.com/blog/2019/02/25/nginx-conneg/)
- [apache](https://linkingresearch.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/how-to-properly-publish-a-vocabulary-or-ontology-in-the-web-part-4-of-6/)

You now have all the information you need to publish your vocabulary online in a friendly manner for people and programs who need to read it.
