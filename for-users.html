<p>Unlike many of today's platforms, Solid returns the web to its original vision of empowering individuals and enabling collaboration. You choose which applications to use with your data rather than being locked into specific platforms. New services, applications and AI agents can access your information instantly with your permission, encouraging innovation. Your data remains yours even when you change providers or try new services, applications or AI agents.</p>
