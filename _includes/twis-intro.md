Hello and welcome to another edition of This Month in Solid!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a monthly summary of Solid progress.
