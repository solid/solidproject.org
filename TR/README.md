This repository contains the source code of the [Solid specification](https://solid.github.io/specification/),
which aims to be a clear, unambiguous, and implementable rewrite of the [Unofficial Draft](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/).

For the time being, while the migration is in progress, please refer to the existing draft documents if you want to implement a pod server or a solid app.

A fair number of spec improvements are currently in the making. If you want to contribute, please refer to a relevant [Solid panel](https://github.com/solid/culture/blob/master/panels.md).

Please join the chat room for spec-related issues at https://gitter.im/solid/specification. Feel free to ask any question you may have about the Solid spec, or just say hi!
