# solidproject.org website strategy

solidproject.org is a hub for:
* a single source of truth describing what Solid is (and is not)
* updates on the Solid specification work as governed by the [agreed process](https://github.com/solid/process)
* listing developer tools offered by other parties to implement the Solid specification
* listing of implementation of the Solid specification into user products (i.e. apps, Pods, identity providers)
* news about Solid

## aim and target audience of website

| Target Audience  | Aim |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Enterprises  | to provide an adequate overview of why and how to implement Solid in their enterprise  |
| Developers | to provide an adequate overview of information to be able to implement Solid technically  |
| Users  | to provide an adequate overview of why and how to use Solid  |

## Three most important user paths
1. Enterprises: https://solidproject.org/implement with aim to convince enterprises to implement Solid
2. Developers: https://solidproject.org/developers with aim to start building an app
3. Users: https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod with aim to start using an app

## Sitemap

The sitemap is intended to help track URIs that are allocated to the resources under [`solidproject.org`](https://solidproject.org/). The sitemap data *is incomplete* (as of 2024-03-05) and will need to be updated as content and URI strategy change (see also https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/issues/249). The table should take 2xx, 3xx, 4xx status codes into account for all assets, including documents and media files that are newly made available, as well as those that were available in the past (redirect, not found, gone, etc.).

* url: URL of the tracked resource
* status: intended status code in response to `HTTP GET`
* design: information about the design (including architectural, presentational, behavioural) of the resource
* note: supplementary notes

The table is alphabetically sorted by lexical url.
